## Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)
Hello, my name is Mohammed Riad, and I live in Egypt, a developing country. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course "The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking." Because I do not have any particular source of income and I don't earn enough money, and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me gain valuable knowledge in networks and security. I have been searching for a job from a long time to earn money for taking this course, and I did not find yet. As time goes on, receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies, and by taking it to qualify to take off a paid internship and take another course in networks path. I want to invest in my career and education, but now, I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my job, not the money. Hopefully, this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, want to improve my programming knowledge and new technologies, and am eager to work and advance in my career.


## How will taking this course help you achieve your career goals? (150 words minimum required)
I have a solid background in "math and algorithms and problem-solving skills," so I am eager to learn "machine learning" and that's the course's first step for me to do good projects that help humanity for an easy life and solve the big problem. My main career goal is to learn every day; I want to learn and progress in my career. "Programming" requires constant learning and improving, and taking a course can help me advance my knowledge.

I plan on gaining additional skills by taking related classes and continuing my involvement with various professional associations. I noticed that a lot of company provides internship and jobs in the related field, and I would certainly be interested in taking it and improving myself to be a pioneer of "machine learning and deep learning." There are many opportunities in this field that the candidate can join but must have good knowledge to join these opportunities, so I see that this course with good tutorials and exercises to join me in the world's largest companies and creativity in this area
## If you answered no, please help us understand why.?
Because there are alot of developing countries the average rate of income is low and not enough personal needs for home so it isn't enough to get paid courses, and we need a lot of free courses for learning and improving ourselves and hlep the humanity and society.
