Hello, my name is Mohammed Riad, and I live in Egypt, a developing country. I'm applying for Financial Aid for the course "The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking." Because I do not have any particular source of income and I don't earn enough money, and I can't afford the full tuition at this time of my life and career. Receiving Financial Aid for this course will help me gain valuable knowledge in networks and security. I have been searching for a job from a long time to earn money for taking this course, and I did not find yet. As time goes on, receiving financial aid will allow me to focus on my studies, and by taking it to qualify to take off a paid internship and take another course in networks path. I want to invest in my career and education, but now, I can only invest my time to increase my knowledge and advance in my job, not the money. Hopefully, this will change in the upcoming years because I'm ambitious, want to improve my programming knowledge and new technologies, and am eager to work and advance in my career.
